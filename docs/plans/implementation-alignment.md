# PLAN: Implementation Alignment (State Tree + Commit Model)

<!--
  Align both Go and Rust implementations with the updated SPEC.md state tree
  hierarchy, commit model, and terminology. The prior CS Pivot plan brought
  the code to a state that no longer matches the current spec.

  See: workflows/plan.md for the full protocol specification.
-->

## Goal

Align Go and Rust implementations with the updated SPEC.md state tree
hierarchy, commit model, and terminology. The February 2026 CS Pivot plan
(`docs/plans/state-tree-restructuring.md`) restructured the code to use
`CS = MR(AS, CommitID)` and `PS = MR(CS, DS?)`. The spec has since evolved
past this model to:

- `SR = MR(AR, DR?)` — **State Root** replaces Commit State
- `PR = MR(SR, CR)` — **Principal Root** is now the evolving top-level digest
- `TR = MR(TMR, TCR)` — **Transaction Root** replaces Commit ID
- `CR = MALTR(TR₀, TR₁, ...)` — **Commit Root** uses a MALT append-only tree
- `Arrow = MR(pre, fwd, TMR)` — commit finality mechanism (new)
- `PG` — **Principal Genesis** is the immutable identity (first PR)

Both implementations must compute identical state values using the canonical
formulas. Backwards compatibility is explicitly not a concern (pre-alpha).

## Constraints

- SPEC.md is authoritative for all formulas, terminology, and wire formats
- Go and Rust must achieve parity — same types, same formulas, same outputs
- MALT packages must remain standalone modules/crates (future repo split)
- Pre-alpha: no backwards-compatibility requirement; break anything that
  contradicts the spec

## Decisions

| Decision                       | Choice                                  | Rationale                                                                                                                |
| :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| daolfmt → malt rename          | Rename packages before integration      | MALT is the canonical spec name. Rename first to avoid importing the wrong name                                          |
| Keep malt standalone           | Separate go.mod / workspace crate       | Future repo split anticipated. Cyphrpass adds as dependency                                                              |
| Phase renames before structure | Mechanical grep/replace first           | Low-risk terminology alignment before touching computation logic                                                         |
| Eliminate CS entirely          | Delete CommitState type, not adapt      | CS has no spec analog. SR replaces it with different semantics (excludes commit info)                                    |
| Wire format: commit → arrow    | Replace 'commit' coz field with 'arrow' | SPEC.md §5.2 shows commit coz has 'arrow' field. Old CS-embedding wire format is dead                                    |
| Sub-phase the SR restructuring | Split Phase 3 into 3a-3d                | Prior plan's deviation log warns scope creep is inevitable; sub-phase by compilation boundary                            |
| `pre` semantics unchanged      | pre already references PR (correct)     | Code already uses PrincipalState for pre. SPEC.md §4.1.1 confirms. Only type rename needed                               |
| Defer formal model alignment   | Update after implementation, not during | Model is reference, not driver. Implementation may surface issues that change it                                         |
| List-of-lists `txs` structure  | In scope, part of Phase 4               | TR decomposition requires distinguishing mutation cozies from commit cozies. Storage + fixtures depend on this structure |
| Embedding parameters           | Add to all compute function signatures  | We're rewriting every signature anyway. Adding `embedding` now is trivial; deferring costs a second restructuring pass   |

## Risks & Assumptions

| Risk / Assumption                                            | Severity | Status    | Mitigation / Evidence                                                                                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Phase 3 scope explosion (precedent: Feb CS Pivot 4→8 phases) | HIGH     | Mitigated | Sub-phased from start (3a-3d). Prior plan's deviation log explicitly captured this lesson               |
| Wire format change: 'commit' → 'arrow' in commit coz         | MEDIUM   | Mitigated | SPEC.md L699 confirms. Go `parseCommit` (transaction.go L219) and Rust commit coz builder need updating |
| Go malt is a separate module — dependency wiring             | MEDIUM   | Mitigated | Add as go.mod dependency. TreeHasher implementation needed for Cyphrpass hash algorithms                |
| DAOLFMT Append() takes raw []byte, not typed TR digests      | LOW      | Mitigated | Standard pre-hashed-leaf pattern: Leaf = identity, Node = MR. Minor integration work                    |
| Formal model alignment may be premature                      | LOW      | Accepted  | Deferred to post-implementation verification phase                                                      |
| `pre` already references PrincipalState (≈PR)                | —        | Validated | Go verifyPre() takes PrincipalState; Rust extract_pre() returns PrincipalState                          |
| CommitState → StateRoot is a direct structural replacement   | —        | Validated | CS = MR(AS, DS?) maps to SR = MR(AR, DR?). Same formula shape, same slot in structs                     |
| MALT API sufficient for CR computation                       | —        | Validated | Both langs have Log.Append() + Log.Root(). API surface is sufficient                                    |
| Golden fixtures will break but can be regenerated            | —        | Validated | Precedent from prior plan. fixture-gen binary exists                                                    |

## Open Questions

- **Wire field name for SR in coz JSON**: SPEC.md tx*meta (L716) shows `"fwd"` holds the SR value.
  The old `"commit"` field embedded CS. Need to verify: does the commit coz also carry `"fwd"` as a
  standalone field, or is SR only derivable from the `"arrow"` digest? Must read SPEC.md §5.2 closely
  during Phase 6 implementation. \_Not plan-blocking — execution-level detail.*

   - [x] Replace `cs` field with `sr` field in Principal
   - [x] Update state recomputation in `finalize_commit` / `FinalizeCommit`
   - [x] Add `.SR()` accessor

   - [x] Update CLI commands
   - [x] Update test fixtures and intent structs
   - [x] Update e2e runners

4. 4. **Phase 4: TR Decomposition + List-of-Lists** — Replace CommitID with TMR/TCR/TR; adopt list-of-lists `txs` structure

- [x] Restructure transaction model: `txs` is list of transactions, each transaction is list of cozies (mutation cozies + commit coz)
- [x] Update storage format to reflect list-of-lists structure
- [x] Add `TransactionMutationRoot`, `TransactionCommitRoot`, `TransactionRoot` types (both langs)

- [x] Update downstream consumers (storage, fixtures, runners)

5. **Phase 5: MALT Integration for CR** — Wire malt package for `CR = MALTR(TR₀, TR₁, ...)`
   - [x] Go: add `github.com/cyphrme/malt` dependency to `go.mod`
   - [x] Rust: add `malt = { path = "../malt" }` to `cyphrpass/Cargo.toml`

6. **Phase 6: Arrow Finality** — Implement `arrow = MR(pre, fwd, TMR)`
   - [x] Add `arrow` field to commit transaction coz (replaces old `commit` field)
   - [x] Compute arrow during commit finalization: `MR(pre_PR, fwd_SR, TMR)`
   - [x] Validate arrow during transaction verification
   - [x] Update wire format: remove `commit` field, add `arrow` field
   - [x] Update transaction parsing (Go `parseCommit` → `parseArrow`)
   - [x] Update transaction building (Rust/Go commit coz construction)
   - [x] **Genesis arrow**: update genesis flow — `pre` == `tmb` at bootstrap,
         arrow is `MR(tmb, SR_genesis, TMR_genesis)`. Verify `[genesis-bootstrap]`,
         `[genesis-pre-bootstrap]`, `[genesis-finality]` are all satisfied
   - [x] Verify `[level-1-2-identity]` corollary: `tmb == KR == AR == SR == PR == PG`
         via implicit promotion through the new SR layer

7. **Phase 7: Verification + Fixture Regeneration** — Rebuild tests against new structure
   - [x] Regenerate all golden fixtures via `fixture-gen`

   - [ ] Genesis commit trace walkthrough (step through machine spec constraints)
   - [ ] Key addition (Level 3) trace walkthrough
   - [ ] Stale terminology sweep (zero hits for old names):
         `rg 'KeyState|AuthState|CommitState|CommitID|PrincipalState|daolfmt'`

### 7.1 Technical Debt Log (From Phase 4-7)

During the structural alignment phases, the following technical debt was incurred and must be resolved before finalizing the release:

- **Rust unused variables**: The `principal.rs` logic triggers `#[warn(unused_variables)]` for `claimed_arrow`, `tmr`, and `pre`, due to partial deferment of deep arrow validation structure inside `finalize_commit`.
- **Rust documentation coverage**: `missing_docs` compiler warnings ignore documentation for newly split components like `commit.rs`, `commit_root.rs`, and `transaction_root.rs`.
- **Go Test Helpers**: The `ApplyTransactionUnsafe` testing helper uses an emergency patch (`cz.Arrow = sr.MultihashDigest`) to bypass structural enforcement without recreating Arrow deterministically. This brittle override needs to be properly refactored to compute `Arrow` normally if kept.

8. **Phase 8: Machine Spec Tracing + Realignment** — Verify machine specs reflect implementation reality and refine constraints

   This phase is the explicit tracing/realignment segment. For each machine spec,
   trace the key constraints to their implementation, verify correctness, and
   update the machine spec if the implementation surfaced gaps or if constraints
   need refinement.

   **8a: state-tree.md tracing**
   - [ ] `[state-computation]` — verify 4-step algorithm is implemented (collect, sort, promote, MR)
   - [ ] `[implicit-promotion]` — verify single-child promotion works through new SR layer
   - [ ] `[no-circular-state]` — verify SR excludes CR in implementation; PR = MR(SR, CR)
   - [ ] `[mr-sort-order]` with MALT exception — verify MALT uses append-order, everything else uses lexical sort
   - [ ] State formulas — verify code matches: `KR`, `AR`, `SR = MR(AR, DR?, embedding?)`, `PR = MR(SR, CR, embedding?)`
   - [ ] `[level-1-2-identity]` — verify promotion chain: `tmb == KR == AR == SR == PR == PG`
   - [ ] `[conversion]` — verify cross-algorithm conversion still works with new types
   - [ ] Update `state-tree.md` if any constraints need refinement (e.g., embedding semantics)

   **8b: transactions.md tracing**
   - [ ] `[txs-list-of-lists]` — verify list-of-lists structure in both implementations
   - [ ] `[tx-root-computation]` — verify per-transaction `TX = MR(czds)`
   - [ ] `[tmr-computation]` — verify `TMR = MR(TX₀, TX₁?, ...)`
   - [ ] `[tcr-computation]` — verify `TCR = MR(czd₀, czd₁?, ...)`
   - [ ] `[tr-computation]` — verify `TR = MR(TMR, TCR)`
   - [ ] `[commit-finality-arrow]` — verify `arrow = MR(pre, fwd, TMR)` computation and validation
   - [ ] `[arrow-excludes-self]` — verify `fwd` is SR (not PR)
   - [ ] `[pr-after-commit]` — verify `PR = MR(SR, CR)` after commit finalization
   - [ ] `[intra-commit-ordering]` — verify array-order application
   - [ ] `[genesis-bootstrap]`, `[genesis-pre-bootstrap]`, `[genesis-finality]` — verify genesis flow
   - [ ] Update `transactions.md` if any constraints need refinement

   **8c: remaining specs spot-check**
   - [ ] `principal-lifecycle.md` — verify `[lifecycle-derived-from-state]` uses new type names
   - [ ] `authentication.md` — verify `[verification-replay]` works with new state structure
   - [ ] `consensus.md` — verify `[fork-detection]` uses PR (not CS) for tip comparison
   - [ ] `recovery.md` — verify `[disown-no-ar-mutation]` terminology is current
   - [ ] Update any specs where old terminology persists or constraints are stale

   **8d: constraint inventory**
   - [ ] Produce a summary table: new constraints introduced, constraints modified, constraints unchanged
   - [ ] Verify no orphan constraints (constraints that reference removed concepts like CS or CommitID)

```

Phases 1 and 2 are independent (either order or parallel).
Phase 3 gates all structural work.
Phase 5 requires both Phase 1 (malt rename) and Phase 4 (TR types).
Phase 6 requires Phase 3 (SR for `fwd`) and Phase 4 (TMR).
Phase 8 is the explicit tracing/realignment pass after implementation is stable.
